df$dt <- ymd(df$date)
complete_df <- subset(df, !is.na(steps))
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r}
total_steps <- sum(complete_df$steps)
total_days <- as.numeric(difftime(max(complete_df$dt),min(df$dt),units="days"))
total_steps/total_days
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values

```{r}
summary(df)
```


## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
